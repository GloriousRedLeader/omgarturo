# Automate bod building (both small and large). You just dump all your bods into the starting
# container and it will sort them, craft items, fill small bods, combine large bods, etc. 
#
# WARNING: IF  YOU SET craftContainer AS YOUR BACKPACK IT YOU RISK LOSING ITEMS.
#
# Quirks:
#   - If you fail to create an alchemy potion, it drops the bottle in your backpack for some reason. 
#
# Requirements:
#   - You need a container to do work in (put a bag in your backpack)
#   - You need a container of resources (ingots, etc.)
#   - You need a container of tools
#   - You need a forge and anvil nearby
#   - You need containers for incomplete (unsorted or not started bods), dump all bods here (large and small)
#   - You need a container for complete small bods (solo)
#   - You need containers for complete small bods (part of larger bods)
#   - You need a container for complete large bods
#
# You just need to specify a few containers, have a resource container fully stocked, 
# have a container of tools, and you are good to go. Supports: Blacksmithing, Tailoring,
# Alchemy, Inscription, Carpentry. Has these features:
#   - auto crafts items
#   - cleans up crafted items that dont meet requirements (non exceptional)
#   - puts completed large bods and solo small bods in containers for easy access and turn-in
#   - If you only want inscription bods to be complete, just put inscription bods in the incompleteBodsContainer.
#   
# General flow:
# 1. Small Bods
#   - selects small bods from incompleBodContainer and craftContainer
#   - filters for only those that match your list of recipes (see recipes param below)
#   - filters for only those bods that have allowed resources (e.g. normal iron ingot bods only)
#   - One craft cycle includes:
#       1. getting resources from resourceContainer
#       2. getting / using tool, setting resource in gump, setting category in gump
#       3. attempting craft
#       4. attempting to add crafted item to small bod
#       5. attempt cleanup: salvage or dump waste into a container (trash bin recommended)
#   - Puts completed small bod in either completeSmallBodContainer or smallBodWaitingForLargeBodContainer
#   - (the above depends on whether this is a solo small bod or is part of a large bod)
#   - Note: Will attempt to meditate if mana is low for inscription
#
# 2. Large Bods
#   - Creates a database of all small bods
#   - Gets large bods from the incompleBodContainer, sorts them by "most complete"
#   - (the above happens so we focus on completion and dont spread too thin)
#   - Looks up small bods in db, transfers to backpack, attempts to combine
#   - If complete, moves to completeLargeBodContainer, otherwise back to incompleBodContainer
#
# Based on:
