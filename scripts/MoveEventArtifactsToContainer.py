# Main Script Code
# ===============================================
# Scans backpack for "of the three", "of wildfire", etc. 
# and moves to a container. This is just a dumper script.
# I like to turn in my arties on just one char, so my other
# chars use this to offload. Too lazy to click and drag
# or even use taz uo alt + click.
